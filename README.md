This was a gaming project assigned to us in our CT-175 programming fundamentals course, 

The game name is Pongiverse, it is a 2 player game where the players control paddels while having a ball move around on the field. The game consists of 3 modes;

Requirements for the code to run:
You need to set up raylib on your pc/laptop and if you are running the code on your vs make sure the raylib files are in the folder where your game's code is
The code is available in the following file : pongiverse3.0(Updated).c

for this to work you need to have raylib installed in your system and then download these files and then you are good to go.
